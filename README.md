# hMos: A better Windows experience

## Greetings:
Hi, I'm hM, a person who creates this new OS based on the half-ass Windows 10 and Windows 11, which are being reviewed a little bad due to the performance, bugs and errors. I have the ideas of hMos while I was seeing Ghost Spectre Windows version, I wonder if I can improve Windows 10, 11 or not to make people fell in love with Windows 10, 11 being customized by me. So, after that, I started developing hMos. And hMos released =))

### What did this version do?
- Improve the performance
- Remove all unnecessary apps, services
- Disable Windows Update [in the Non-Services version, which disabled almost everything and only remains some neccessary apps, UWP apps, services.
- 2 options for you: + Non-Services version [disabled almost everything and only remains some neccessary apps, UWP apps, services]
                     + Only-Services version [disabled unnecessary things make Windows becomes slower, ... and remains Windows Update, PDF Reader, Microsoft Edge]
- Being activated [Windows Pro]
