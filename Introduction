Hi, I'm hM, a person who creates this new OS based on the half-ass Windows 10 and Windows 11, which are being reviewed a little bad due to the performance, bugs and errors.
I have the ideas of hMos while I was seeing Ghost Spectre Windows version, I wonder if I can improve Windows 10, 11 or not to make people fell in love with Windows 10, 11 being customized by me. So, after that, I started developing hMos. And hMos released =))
